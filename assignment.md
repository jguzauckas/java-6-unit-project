# The Problem(s)

I have selected three problems from previous years of the Advent of Code project for you to work on. Each of the problems has a Part 1 and a Part 2, resulting in 6 total answers.

## For Each Problem

Each of the problems is provided in its own folder, containing the following resources:
- `Assignment201X.md` - Description of the problem and what you need to know about it.
- `input.txt` - The problem input to be processed for the answer.
- `Assignment201X.java` - The main file for work regarding the answer to be put. **Do not edit any existing code in the file, just add your code where there is a comment to do so.**
- `answer.txt` - The correct answer to the current problem input. Your answer must match the answer in this file exactly (down to the sentence!).
- Other files might include class files for custom classes that you might write to help solve the problem.

## Testing Solutions

A correct result for these problems is not just hitting run once and seeing it produce the right answer per the `answer.txt` file. Running the `Setup.java` file will create a brand new input for you to try out, as well as its accompanying answer. You should then run your solution again to see if the answer still matches despite the different input values. If it matches after cycling multiple versions of the input, then this is a great sign that your solution is correct.
