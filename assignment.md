# The Problem(s)

I have selected three problems from previous years of the Advent of Code project for you to work on. Each of the problems has a Part 1 and a Part 2, resulting in 6 total answers.

## Interacting with this Repository

Your solution to this problem will be coded in the `Assignment.java` file. It already has existing code set up to initialize the `String` variable `puzzleInput` so you can begin working.

To see the puzzle input, look in the `string.txt` file. Note that the `String` of parentheses is roughly 7,000 characters long, so this is not a puzzle you can calculate the answer to by hand (at least not reasonably).

Since it will not be easy to determine the answer by hand, the answer to your input has been included in the `answer.txt` file for your reference. Use this to determine if you got the final answers right.

Running the `Setup.java` file will randomly generate a new string of parentheses in the `string.txt` file (and therefore the `String` you are coding with), as well as a new answer based on that new `String` in the `answer.txt` file.

## Your Answer

You should format your answer based on the formatting in `answer.txt`, down to the capitalization and punctuation.

Verify that your work is accurate once you think you are done, by alternating between running `Assignment.java`, checking your answer via the `answer.txt` file, and then running `Setup.java` to shuffle the input and test again. This will ensure that you have a solid, working solution and not just one that works in particular situations.
